Header not included in csv data 
columns in csv corresponds to:
(1) exonic region id,
(2) sample id, 
(3) number of mapped reads,
(4)number of reads in the exonic region,
(5) coverage in exonic region (number of reads in exonic region / read length), 
(6)exonic region length, 
(7) average per nucleotide coverage, 
(8) RPKM

data separated into two directories : control and mutant 

-control dir contains files M/F flies without dsx mutation
  subdir male or female groups data files on sex 
      subdir in male/female correspond to strain of Drosophila 
-mutant dir contains files M/F with dsx mutation
  subdir male or female groups data files on sex
      subdir unknown holds data files since strain of Drosophila is not identified
